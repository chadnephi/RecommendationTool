                Depends on what you're wanting to invest in. For an IUL

                Last note, I would be careful about a "minimum amount" mindset.

                Almost all investments have fees. What is important is what are

              <td>
                Again, it's all about what the fees get you. For example, one
                investment might have lower fees, but then you pay more in
                taxes.

                Most of the time, the taxes that people have to pay (especially
                if taxes do go up), are significantly more than fees on
                investments.

                If they won't commit to a set amount, then pick something with
                some flexiblity (just so they feel like they have some freedom),
                and then really hammer the numbers that it takes to be able to
                retire and emphazie that you don't become wealthy by not
                commiting to consistenly putting money towards the future.

                It's possible they don't. You are the professional, do the
                analyzis and you decide if they do or don't. If they do, how
                will you teach that to them? If they don't because they don't
                "need" a death benefit, can you think of other reasons for them
                to get a life insurance? If so, teach them those reasons. Good
                questions help with all of this, coupled with good stories.
